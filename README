To populate using the small data sets:

   mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u USERNAME -D DATABASE -p < setup-small.sql

To populate using the entire data sets:

   mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u USERNAME -D DATABASE -p < setup.sql

Phase C

      During this phase of the project, we were able to take from our design and schemas from
Phase B and create actual database relations and populate them with data. Overall, there were
not many challenges to this process, thanks mostly to the fact that we spent time planning
out the questions we want to answer. This informed how we wanted to design our database.
The trickiest part of this process was processing the data in a format that represented our design.
For example, a problem that we currently have with the data is that some entires have commas, which we
are using to deliniate different attributes. Therefore, some of the data is inaccurate. However, this
issue is only in the Candidate relation and is very limited. Moving into the next phase, we will try
our best to continue making sure that the data is accurate and accessible. But due to the large data
set and the limited time we have on this phase, we were unable to make that fix here. Despite this, we have
no concerns about our project and we look forward to moving on to the next phase.
